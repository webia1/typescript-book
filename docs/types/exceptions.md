# Exception Handling

JavaScript has an `Error` class that you can use for exceptions. You throw an error with the `throw` keyword. You can catch it with a `try` / `catch` block pair e.g.

```js
try {
  throw new Error('Something bad happened');
}
catch(e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

## Error Sub Types

Beyond the built in `Error` class there are a few additional built-in error classes that inherit from `Error` that the JavaScript runtime can throw:

### RangeError

Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a numeric variable or parameter is outside of its valid range.

```js
// Call console with too many arguments
console.log.apply(console, new Array(1000000000)); // RangeError: Invalid array length
```

### ReferenceError

Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when de-referencing an invalid reference. e.g.

```js
'use strict';
console.log(notValidVar); // ReferenceError: notValidVar is not defined
```

### SyntaxError

Creates an instance representing a syntax error that occurs while parsing code that isn't valid JavaScript.

```js
1***3; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token *
```

### TypeError

Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a variable or parameter is not of a valid type.

```js
('1.2').toPrecision(1); // TypeError: '1.2'.toPrecision is not a function
```

### URIError

Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when `encodeURI()` or `decodeURI()` are passed invalid parameters.

```js
decodeURI('%'); // URIError: URI malformed
```

## Always use `Error`

Beginner JavaScript developers sometimes just throw raw strings e.g.

```js
try {
  throw 'Something bad happened';
}
catch(e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

*Don't do that*. The fundamental benefit of `Error` objects is that they automatically keep track of where they were built and originated with the `stack` property.

Raw strings result in a very painful debugging experience and complicate error analysis from logs.

## You don't have to `throw` an error

It is okay to pass an `Error` object around. This is conventional in Node.js callback style code which takes callbacks with the first argument as an error object.

```js
function myFunction (callback: (e?: Error)) {
  doSomethingAsync(function () {
    if (somethingWrong) {
      callback(new Error('This is my error'))
    } else {
      callback();
    }
  });
}
```

## Exceptional cases

`Exceptions should be exceptional` is a common saying in computer science. There are a few reasons why this is true for JavaScript (and TypeScript) as well.

### Unclear where it is thrown

Consider the following piece of code:

```js
try {
  const foo = runTask1();
  const bar = runTask2();
}
catch(e) {
  console.log('Error:', e);
}
```

The next developer cannot know which function might throw the error. The person reviewing the code cannot know without reading the code for task1 / task2 and other functions they might call etc.

### Makes graceful handling hard

You can try to make it graceful with explicit catch around each thing that might throw:

```js
try {
  const foo = runTask1();
}
catch(e) {
  console.log('Error:', e);
}
try {
  const bar = runTask2();
}
catch(e) {
  console.log('Error:', e);
}
```

But now if you need to pass stuff from the first task to the second one the code becomes messy: (notice `foo` mutation requiring `let` + explicit need for annotating it because it cannot be inferred from the return of `runTask1`):

```ts
let foo: number; // Notice use of `let` and explicit type annotation
try {
  foo = runTask1();
}
catch(e) {
  console.log('Error:', e);
}
try {
  const bar = runTask2(foo);
}
catch(e) {
  console.log('Error:', e);
}
```

### Not well represented in the type system

Consider the function:

```ts
function validate(value: number) {
  if (value < 0 || value > 100) throw new Error('Invalid value');
}
```

Using `Error` for such cases is a bad idea as it is not represented in the type definition for the validate function (which is `(value:number) => void`). Instead a better way to create a validate method would be:

```ts
function validate(value: number): {error?: string} {
  if (value < 0 || value > 100) return {error:'Invalid value'};
}
```

And now its represented in the type system.

> Unless you want to handle the error in a very generic (simple / catch-all etc) way, don't *throw* an error.
