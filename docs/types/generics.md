## Generics

The key motivation for generics is to document meaningful type dependencies between members. The members can be:

* Class instance members
* Class methods
* function arguments
* function return value

## Motivation and samples

Consider the simple `Queue` (first in, first out) data structure implementation. A simple one in TypeScript / JavaScript looks like:

```ts
class Queue {
  private data = [];
  push(item) { this.data.push(item); }
  pop() { return this.data.shift(); }
}
```

One issue with this implementation is that it allows people to add *anything* to the queue and when they pop it - it can be *anything*. This is shown below, where someone can push a `string` onto the queue while the usage actually assumes that only `numbers` were pushed in:

```ts
class Queue {
  private data = [];
  push(item) { this.data.push(item); }
  pop() { return this.data.shift(); }
}

const queue = new Queue();
queue.push(0);
queue.push("1"); // Oops a mistake

// a developer walks into a bar
console.log(queue.pop().toPrecision(1));
console.log(queue.pop().toPrecision(1)); // RUNTIME ERROR
```

One solution (and in fact the only one in languages that don't support generics) is to go ahead and create *special* classes just for these constraints. E.g. a quick and dirty number queue:

```ts
class QueueNumber extends Queue {
  push(item: number) { super.push(item); }
  pop(): number { return this.data.shift(); }
}

const queue = new QueueNumber();
queue.push(0);
queue.push("1"); // ERROR : cannot push a string. Only numbers allowed

// ^ if that error is fixed the rest would be fine too
```

Of course this can quickly become painful e.g. if you want a string queue you have to go through all that effort again. What you really want is a way to say that whatever the type is of the stuff getting *pushed* it should be the same for whatever gets *popped*. This is done easily with a *generic* parameter (in this case, at the class level):

```ts
/** A class definition with a generic parameter */
class Queue<T> {
  private data = [];
  push(item: T) { this.data.push(item); }
  pop(): T | undefined { return this.data.shift(); }
}

/** Again sample usage */
const queue = new Queue<number>();
queue.push(0);
queue.push("1"); // ERROR : cannot push a string. Only numbers allowed

// ^ if that error is fixed the rest would be fine too
```

Another example that we have already seen is that of a *reverse* function, here the constraint is between what gets passed into the function and what the function returns:

```ts
function reverse<T>(items: T[]): T[] {
    var toreturn = [];
    for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        toreturn.push(items[i]);
    }
    return toreturn;
}

var sample = [1, 2, 3];
var reversed = reverse(sample);
console.log(reversed); // 3,2,1

// Safety!
reversed[0] = '1';     // Error!
reversed = ['1', '2']; // Error!

reversed[0] = 1;       // Okay
reversed = [1, 2];     // Okay
```

In this section you have seen examples of generics being defined *at class level* and at *function level*. One minor addition worth mentioning is that you can have generics created just for a member function. As a toy example consider the following where we move the `reverse` function into a `Utility` class:

```ts
class Utility {
  reverse<T>(items: T[]): T[] {
      var toreturn = [];
      for (let i = items.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
          toreturn.push(items[i]);
      }
      return toreturn;
  }
}
```

> TIP: You can call the generic parameter whatever you want. It is conventional to use `T`, `U`, `V` when you have simple generics. If you have more than one generic argument try to use meaningful names e.g. `TKey` and `TValue` (conventional to prefix with `T` as generics are also called *templates* in other languages e.g. C++).


### Design Pattern: Convenience generic

Consider the function: 

```ts
declare function parse<T>(name: string): T;
```

In this case you can see that the type `T` is only used in one place. So there is no constraint *between* members. This is equivalent to a type assertion in terms of type safety:

```ts
declare function parse(name: string): any;

const something = parse('something') as TypeOfSomething;
```

Generics used *only once* are no better than an assertion in terms of type safety. That said they do provide *convenience* to your API.

A more obvious example is a function that loads a json response. It returns a promise of *whatever type you pass in*:
```ts
const getJSON = <T>(config: {
    url: string,
    headers?: { [key: string]: string },
  }): Promise<T> => {
    const fetchConfig = ({
      method: 'GET',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      ...(config.headers || {})
    });
    return fetch(config.url, fetchConfig)
      .then<T>(response => response.json());
  }
```

Note that you still have to explicitly annotate what you want, but the `getJSON<T>` signature `(config) => Promise<T>` saves you a few key strokes (you don't need to annotate the return type of `loadUsers` as it can be inferred):

```ts
type LoadUsersResponse = {
  users: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
  }[];  // array of user objects
}
function loadUsers() {
  return getJSON<LoadUsersResponse>({ url: 'https://example.com/users' });
}
```

Also `Promise<T>` as a return value is definitely better than alternatives like `Promise<any>`.

Another example is where a generic is only used as an argument: 

```ts
declare function send<T>(arg: T): void;
```

Here the generic `T` can be used to annote the type that you want the argument to match e.g. 

```ts
send<Something>({
  x:123,
  // Also you get autocomplete  
}); // Will TSError if `x:123` does not match the structure expected for Something

```
